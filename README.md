# TremorXAI
(A collaborative project by Alan Jacob Anil (@lilnewbie), Aleena Bosco Kurumthottam (@AleenaBoscoK), Shaahid Ahmed N (@shaahid-ahmed))

This repository contains the implementation of an explainable AI (XAI) model inspired by the paper:
Explainable artificial intelligence for searching frequency characteristics in Parkinson's disease tremor (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45802-z)

While the original paper focused on time-series accelerometry data, our project explores the generalizability of their novel timeseries-based XAI method on image data. Specifically, we use the publicly available Parkinson‚Äôs Drawings Dataset from Kaggle, which contains spiral and wave drawings made by individuals with and without Parkinson‚Äôs Disease

**üìÅ Dataset:**
**Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/parkinsons-drawings

Contains hand-drawn spirals and waves labeled for Parkinson‚Äôs diagnosis.
